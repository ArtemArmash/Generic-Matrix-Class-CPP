# Generic Matrix Class in C++ with Operator Overloading

This project is a C++ implementation of a generic `Matrix` class using templates. Thanks to its templated design (`template<class T>`), this class can create and manage matrices of various data types, such as `int`, `float`, or `double`.

## About The Project

This code serves as an excellent example for learning several advanced C++ concepts, including:

*   **Class Templates**: Creating generic code that is reusable for different data types.
*   **Dynamic Memory Management**: Manually allocating and deallocating memory for a 2D array using `new[]` and `delete[]`.
*   **Operator Overloading**: Implementing intuitive arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) and stream insertion (`<<`) for easy use.
*   **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods that operate on the data within a single class.

## Core Features

*   **Generic Data Type**: Works with any data type that supports basic arithmetic operations.
*   **Dynamic Sizing**: Matrices can be created with any number of rows and columns at runtime.
*   **Data Population**: Supports both manual console input (`Add`) and random value generation (`RandomAdd`).
*   **Data Analysis**: Includes methods to find the minimum (`SearchMin`) and maximum (`SeacrhMax`) elements in the matrix.
*   **Overloaded Operators**:
    *   `<<`: For easy printing of the matrix to an output stream like `std::cout`.
    *   `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`: For performing element-wise arithmetic operations.

## How to Build and Run

You will need a C++ compiler (e.g., G++, Clang, or MSVC).

1.  Save the code to a file named `main.cpp`.
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt in the file's directory.
3.  Compile the code using your compiler:
    ```sh
    g++ main.cpp -o matrix_generic_app
    ```
4.  Run the compiled executable:
    ```sh
    ./matrix_generic_app
    ```
    On Windows:
    ```cmd
    matrix_generic_app.exe
    ```
